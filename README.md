# AI Travel Planner

Welcome to the AI Travel Planner project! This project aims to provide users with personalized travel recommendations using advanced AI models for both text and image generation.

## Overview

The AI Travel Planner utilizes the following components:

- **LLAMA3 Text Generation Model**: This model, developed by Meta AI, is at the heart of our travel recommendation system. It generates personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences and constraints.

- **Stability Diffusion Model**: Leveraging the Hugging Face library, this model generates images to complement the textual recommendations. It ensures a diverse set of visually appealing options for users.
